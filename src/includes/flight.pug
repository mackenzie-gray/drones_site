        p Drone flight takes place when the upward force created by the spinning rotors exceeds the weight of the craft. 
        p To achieve take-off, a drone propels all 4 rotors at high speed creating a large upward force until it is off the ground.
        p Once in flight, the quadcopter hovers by lowering the speed of its 4 rotors until the force generated by them is equal to the downward force against the drone.
        p When not hovering or moving straight upward the drone has 3 types of control, similar to that of a plane: <b>Roll, Pitch</b> and <b>Yaw.</b>

        p Roll is the left-to-right tilt of the vehicle in the air. To achieve this, the drone decreases the speed of the rotors on the side that it would like to title towards and increases the speed of the other two rotors. This changes the direction of the net forces acting on the copter causing it to tilt in the respective direction.

        h5 Pitch
        div(class="pitch-img")
          img(src=require('../assets/img/drone2.png'))
        p Similar to roll, pitch is the front-back tilt of the quadcopter. This is also achieved by decreasing the speed of the rotors in the direction of the tilt and increasing that of the other two. For example, to create forward pitch on the drone, the front rotor's speed is decreasing while the back rotors are increased, the net force acting on the drone now causes it to tilt forward and fly straight through the air.

        h5 Yaw
        div(class="yaw-img")
          img(src=require('../assets/img/drone3.png'))
        p Changing the yaw of the vehicles causes it to turn to the left or right. As mentioned above a quadcopter contains two clockwise and two counter-clockwise spinning rotors. Rotors which spin in the same direction are placed opposite to one another. By either increasing or decreasing the speeds of the rotors spinning the same direction the additional spin created by these rotors causes the entire craft to spin in the respective direction.
